    <h1>My Top 3 Toplaners</h1>
    <div id="Chars Top">
        <div id="Gnar">
            <h2>Gnar</h2>
            <img src="Gnar.jpg" width=275 height=200>
            <p>Gnar has 2 characters inside of him, ranged form called "Mini Gnar" and melee form called "Mega Gnar"<br>
            He doesn't use mana or energy but gathers rage, and that's what he uses to change, When he reaches 100 rage<br>
            he changes to Mega Gnar.<br>
            <b>Mega Gnar:</b> Tanky Melee form, with cc<br>
            <b>Mini Gnar:</b> Ranged form with low cc with quite a lot of range</p>

            <h3>Pros: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ranged where majority are melee</li>
                <li>Melee form gives him a lot of cc, while having a lot of Damage. </li>
                <li>Stacks while in ranged mode, giving him extra Movement speed and <br> extra damage dealt when having enough stacks</li>
                <li>Strong early but also quite strong late game</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Requires more than normal setup due to his nature of turning</li>
                <li>Needs to be in melee to have any cc</li>
                <li>Ranged form doesn't have good resistance stats, making you quite easily killable</li>
                <li>You need to synchronize well with your team with your "Mega form" to be of value </li>
            </ul>

        <div id="Shen">
            <h2>Shen</h2>
            <img src="Shen.jpg" width="275" height="200">
            <p>Shen is a Tank with a strong early game. But the main thing about him is his cross map ult. Giving his ally a shield<br>
            and teleporting to them.</p>
            <h3>Pros: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Very strong early game</li>
                <li>Cross map ult, being able to save teammates or ganking a different lane.</li>
                <li>Easy gank setup with his dash that taunts</li>
                <li>Shield on passive, making it easy to trade favourably</li>
                <li>Skill that blocks auto attacks</li>
                <li>Good splitpushing lategame due to having a tp on your ult and being able to make every fight a 5v4</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Falls off lategame when it comes to damage</li>
                <li>Requires your team to have a brain, as Shen's kit is more supportive</li>
                <li>Taunt is a skillshot, if you miss you got no more movement skills</li>
                <li>Badly used ult early game can completely destroy your lane</li>
            </ul>
