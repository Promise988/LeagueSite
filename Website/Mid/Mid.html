            <img src="/home/promise/Projects/Website/Mid/Azir.jpg" width="250" height="200" alt="Yet to be inserted">
            <p>First one coming to mind, mostly due to personal preference
                would be azir.</p>
            <h3>Pros: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the best late game mage in the game</li>
                <li>Very fun to play</li>
                <li>Always viable in any meta</li>
                <li>A LOT of playmaking potential</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not great early (Very mana hungry, while not doing a lot of damage)</li>
                <li>Very difficult to play to perfection</li>
                <li>Requires a lot of micro managing with his soldiers</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <p>Second one, is one for the adc mains</p>
            <h3>Pros: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Amazingly strong early game poke</li>
                <li>Scales well into late game</li>
                <li>Ranged, makes it easy to deal with the many Melee midlaners</li>
                <li>Dash, low cooldown if you can use spells</li>
                <li>Very fun when it comes to playmaking</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Cons: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can get very mana hungry early game</li>
                <li>Not high resistance/health stats, meaning if you don't dodge you'll get kill quite easily</li>
                <li>No CC making it difficult for him to setup ganks</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="Zed">
            <br>
            <h2>Zed</h2>
            <img src="Mid/zed.jpg" width="275" height="200" alt="Yet to be inserted">
            <p>Last on the list and in my opinion the most fun melee character in the game. So much playmaking when you get the hang of him.</p>
            <h3>Pros: </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Huge amount of early game damage, Wins vs majority of midlaners.</li>
                <li>Very exciting to play, can always playing him differently depending on the matchup</li>
                <li>Has a lot of way to outplay</li>
                <li>A lot of dashing around</li>
                <li>Ultimate ability makes him invinciable for the time he's ulting</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cons: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Very difficult to play, Not to mention when it comes to mastering</li>
                <li>Requires hitting all the abilities to deal damage</li>
                <li>All his abilities are skillshots and dodgable</li>
                <li>Ult can be difficult, as to deal damage with it you have to hit deal damage in the low window that you have</li>
                <li>Abilities have quite a high cooldown early game, so if you miss a lot early you're gonna have a difficult game</li>
                <li>Doesn't scale too well, and very difficult to play when enemies get defensive items</li>
            </ul>
